# Hi there, I'm Samar! 👋

**Flutter Developer**

Welcome to my portfolio! I built this interactive web experience to make it easier for potential clients and employers to explore my work and learn a bit more about me.

## 🚀 Why this Portfolio?

As a developer, I believe in showing more than just code. While I love open source, much of my professional work involves commercial projects protected by **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**. 

To bridge that gap, I've created this portfolio to feature:
-  **Video Demos**: Walkthroughs of major commercial apps I've built, showcasing features I implemented (even if I can't share the repo).
-  **Technical Contributions**: Details on my role, the architecture I used, and the challenges I solved.
-  **Interactive Design**: A clean, responsive UI that demonstrates my Flutter skills right here in the browser!

##  Tech Stack

This portfolio itself is built with **Flutter Web**!
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts gracefully from desktop to mobile.
- **Custom Design**: Glassmorphic UI elements and smooth animations.

## 📫 Get in Touch

I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, collaborations, or just chatting about Flutter!
