# Hi there, I'm Samar! 👋

Welcome to my portfolio! I built this interactive web experience to make it easier for potential clients and employers to explore my work and learn a bit more about me.

## Why this Portfolio?

As a developer, I believe in showing more than just code. While I love open source, much of my professional work involves commercial projects protected by **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**. 

To bridge that gap, I've created this portfolio to feature:
-  **Video Demos**: Walkthroughs of major commercial apps I've built, showcasing features I implemented (even if I can't share the repo).
-  **Technical Contributions**: Details on my role, the architecture I used, and the challenges I solved.
-  **Interactive Design**: A clean, responsive UI that demonstrates my Flutter skills right here in the browser!

##  Tech Stack

This portfolio itself is built with **Flutter Web**!
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts gracefully from desktop to mobile.
- **Custom Design**: Glassmorphic UI elements and smooth animations.


## Published Apps

When browsing the **Projects** section, you will see direct links to the **App Store** and **Google Play Store** for apps that are publicly available. Click the store buttons on the project cards to download and try them out!

## Get in Touch

I'm always open to discussing new opportunities, collaborations, or just chatting about Flutter!

If you fork this repo, you will need to:
1.  Create your own Firebase Project.
2.  Install the FlutterFire CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools` and `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`.
